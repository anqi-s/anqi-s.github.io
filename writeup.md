1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
For me, learning about how to set up a website using Github was the most challenging task, as I spent a lot of time debugging about linking multiple pages. I did not find it challenging to work with HTML and CSS. The overall time for me to finish this assignment was about six hours.
2. What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
Font size was the first thing that came into my mind. Then, I thought about reducing the width of div element to make my navbar compatible. Finally, I reduced the size of the image for better mobile friendly.
3. What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
The most important thing to take into consideration is definitely design. Specifically, I had to decide which HTML element to use when there are multiple feasible choices. For example, when lines of text was needed, I have to choose from p, div/span, table etc. I am particularly proud of my website aesthetics. The content is well-organized and clear.
4. Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?
I will definitely add my project source code in the form of hyperlinks. Additionally, I may renew my hobby page with more iteractive content, such as sharing my daily pictures, or engaging with external movie websites. Moreover, I would love to polish my personal website after mastering higher level techniques, such as React.
5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I spent around six hours in total. I took about one hour to design before I dive into the implementation. Then, I used about five hours to produce my main page and three sub-pages.
6. (Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they?
I thought I need at least one day to finish, but the outcome was quite satisfying for me. I took shorter time than I anticipate.
